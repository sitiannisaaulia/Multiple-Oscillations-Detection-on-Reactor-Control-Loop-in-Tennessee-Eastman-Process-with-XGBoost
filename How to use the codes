BEFORE USING THE OSCILLATION DETECTION PROGRAM 
1. Make sure you have installed the Mosquitto application for data communication 
2. Make sure you have installed the MQTT Explorer application 
3. Make sure you have installed the Python programming language version 3.8.10  

HOW TO USE THE OSCILLATION DETECTION PROGRAM 
1. Run the TEP-mod-plant-mqtt.py program using Visual Studio Code, IDLE Python 3.8.10, or another environment. 
2. Run main.py and type the XMEAS topic you want to subscribe to in the terminal, for example type XMEAS(9). 
3. Open the MQTT Explorer Application, then send topic START_PAUSE = 1 to start the program. 
4. If you want to provide interference, do variable manipulation by changing the variables as follows:    
    a. IDV(4)  = 1 or 0    
    b. IDV(14) = 1 or 0    
    c. gain_10 = -3.12 or -1.56    
   Notes: 
    a. A value of 1 or -3.12 is the value for enabling interference.           
    b. A value of 0 or -1.56 is the value for stopping interruptions. 
5. If you want to finish the program, type the STOP topic in the MQTT Explorer Application to stop the detection program simulation from TEP-mod-plant-mqtt.py. 
6. Close the main.py window to stop the online detection program.
