BEFORE USING THE OSCILLATION DETECTION PROGRAM 
1. Make sure you have installed the Mosquitto application for data communication 
2. Make sure you have installed the MQTT Explorer application 
3. Make sure you have installed the Python programming language version 3.8.10  

HOW TO USE THE ONLINE DETECTION MODEL 
1. Run the TEP_Simulation_to_online_detection.ipynb program using IDLE Python 3.8.10, or another environment.
2. Run Online_Detection_Model.ipynb and type the XMEAS topic you want (the process variable you want to analyze the oscillation and also must be related to the control loop you want to detect) to subscribe to in the terminal, for example type XMEAS(9), reactor temperature. 
3. Open the MQTT Explorer Application, then send topic START_PAUSE = 1 to start the program. 
4. If you want to provide interference, do variable manipulation by changing the variables as follows:    
    a. IDV(4)  = 1 or 0    
    b. IDV(14) = 1 or 0    
    c. gain_10 = -3.12 or -1.56    
   Notes: 
    a. A value of 1 or -3.12 is the value for enabling interference.           
    b. A value of 0 or -1.56 is the value for stopping interruptions. 
5. If you want to detect multiple oscillation, do the step 4 twice as the variables you want. Example : for stiction and mistuned controller, you can set IDV(4)  = 1 or 0 and gain_10 = -3.12 or -1.56
6. If you want to finish the program, type the STOP topic in the MQTT Explorer Application to stop the detection program simulation from TEP_Simulation_to_online_detection.ipynb. 
7. Close the  Online_Detection_Model.ipynb window to stop the online detection program.
